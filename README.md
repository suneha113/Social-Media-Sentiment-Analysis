# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on social media text data to classify texts into negative, neutral, and positive categories using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.
Objective: Analyze social media posts to understand sentiment trends and classify the sentiment expressed in each post.

Data Processing:

1. Text cleaning including removal of stopwords.

2. Word stemming and lemmatization to normalize words to their base forms.

Feature Extraction: Uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into meaningful numerical features suitable for machine learning.

Modeling: Implements and compares classifiers such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for sentiment prediction.

Evaluation: Provides detailed classification reports and confusion matrices to assess the performance of each model.
